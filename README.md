#osint-recon-tool

A basic Python tool that collects open-source intelligence (OSINT) on usernames, IPs, emails, and domains.

## Features
- Social media username search (GitHub, Reddit, etc.)
- Larger social media platforms do not work here for different reasons. Some playforms don't have public user URLs, logins are required, difficult to scrape, etc...

## Syntax
python main.py --username johndoe
